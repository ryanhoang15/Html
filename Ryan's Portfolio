        <p id="name-p">I am a second-year currently attending California State University Long Beach in pursuing my Bachelor Of Science for Computer Science. I can speak two languages Vietnamese, and English. I am an only child and am the first in my family to go to college. In my free time, I like to play football and basketball. I like cooking Italian food such as spaghetti and pasta. On the weekends I like to go to the beach and play basketball. I have always been an achiever either in academics or professional life or sports or any other field in my life. I believe in success through hard work and dedication. I believed that for you to achieve something you must work hard for it. I enjoy life to the fullest and love humor. I am a progressive thinker who likes to take on challenging problems. I have a passion for programming and have been fascinated by computers since I was a little kid. I like learning new programming languages and my favorite is Java. I knew that I wanted to be a software engineer since I was a little kid. My hobbies are that I like to go on hikes, to the beach, bike rides and code. I am currently a member of the ACM - Association for Computing Machinery. Some of my goals are that I hope to get an internship by next summer and a long term goal is to be able to get a job in a field out of college </p>
